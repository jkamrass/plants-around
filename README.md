# Plants Around

[https://plants-around.vercel.app/](https://plants-around.vercel.app/)

This project began as my capstone project for Parsity, an online coding school based in the Triangle. It was originally completed in 9 days and has been evolving since then.

This app enables users to discover and learn what plants are growing all around them in Durham. Users can find locations of plants nearby to visit, add their own plant sightings, and verify other users' sightings.
