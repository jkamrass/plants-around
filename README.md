# Plants Around

[https://plants-around.vercel.app/](https://plants-around.vercel.app/)

This project began as my capstone project for Parsity, an online coding school based in the Triangle. It was originally completed in 9 days and has been evolving since then.

This app enables users to discover and learn what plants are growing all around them in Durham. Users can find locations of plants nearby to visit, add their own plant sightings, and verify other users' sightings.

## About the Project

### Functionality

- On the Explore pages, users can discover what plant species are growing nearby them and explore the map to find locations of plants to visit
- On the Id page, users can submit their own sighting of a plant, uploading a picture and location for their sighting. The app will attempt to verify the sighting automatically with the [Pl@ntNet](https://my.plantnet.org/) Image Recognition API.
- (In Progress) On the Sightings page, users who have created an account can see the status of their recently posted sightings and help to verify the sightings of other users.
